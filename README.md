# SOKOBAN 3D
Unity 3D puzzle game named SOKOBAN.

Sokoban is a puzzle video game genre in which the player pushes crates or boxes around in a map, trying to get them to target locations.
The game consists back to back maps where the aim is always the same. The player must use the given tools to complete the level. 

My version of Sokoban consists of 3 levels for now with 1 player and 3 different objects to push to the proper location. The game has its main menu, pause menu, and end level menu. 
The game automatically saves the player's level state and if continue is pressed in the main menu it starts from the last played level. 
The Player has grid-based movement.
